<h1>Chocolate Pudding from scratch</h1>  
<img src="../images/chocolate-pudding.jpg" alt="Chocolate Pudding in glasses" height="400px">
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>cocoa powder, unsweetened - 60 g</li>
    <li>cornstarch - 40 g</li>
    <li>sugar - 50 g</li>
    <li>plant milk, your favorite - 500 ml</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add about half of the milk to a pot and bring to a boil. Don't forget to stir so it does not burn.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, mix rest of the milk with the other ingredients. Make sure to mix it thoroughly to get rid of any starch clumps.
        That's easier when you use cold milk directly from the fridge.
    </li>
    <li>When milk in the pot boils, add mix from step 2.</li>
    <li>Bring everything to a boil again, stirring constantly. This important to not get clumpy, but creamy pudding!</li>
    <li>Remove from heat when the pudding gets a nice, firm consistency. Distribute it to bowls and either enjoy hot or cold.
        (Personally, I prefer to let it cool first because the starch develops a delicious skin on top.)
    </li>
</ol>
